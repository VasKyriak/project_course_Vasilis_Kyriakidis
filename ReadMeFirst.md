Final Scripts for Protein Structure Prediction Project

### Important information about the uploaded scripÏ„s and files ### 

1) All scripts are compressed inside the zip file, named " Project_Course_Train_Predict_Scripts.zip "

2) The script under the name "TMH_train_modelVasKyr.py" is the script that creates the svm train model and uses the dataset named "307of614_seq_set.txt". The training model that creates is the one named "TMH_Train_Model". The script uses and input to use any preffered database, although the "TMH_Train_Model" is trained only from the "307of614_seq_set.txt".

3) The script under the name "TMH_struct_predictOptimEvaluVasKyr.py" is the one used for optimization and evaluation of the best parameteres, for plotting and for testing.

4) The script under the name "TMH_struct_final_predictVasKyr.py" is the final predictor. It uses and input for the protein sequence file that has the ID of the protein and it's sequence and provides the predicted structure based on the training from the "TMH_Train_Model".
